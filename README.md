# Game Rules
Quantum Monopoly-
Our team has created a fun game of quantum monopoly. Here the two players use the laws of quantum interference to bias the output of the quantum circuit with the help of quantum operation cards such that they land on the most favorable square (square with the highest reward). Beware though, your opponent also has the power to interfere in you circuit and make you less likely to win. This game is aimed at a gentle introduction to quantum computing and strategy.
